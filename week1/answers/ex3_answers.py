Exercise 3 — Answers
====================
Fill this in after completing the three Rasa conversations.

CALM vs Old Rasa — what changed
---------------------------------
The old open-source Rasa approach used:
  - nlu.yml: intent training examples
  - rules.yml: explicit dialogue rules
  - FormValidationAction: Python class to parse slot values

Rasa Pro CALM uses:
  - flows.yml: natural language descriptions of what each flow does
  - from_llm slots: the LLM extracts values from conversation
  - ONE custom action: ActionValidateBooking for the business rules

The conversation is the same from the manager's perspective.
The machinery underneath is completely different.

CONVERSATION SCRIPTS
---------------------
Conversation 1 (happy path):
  You:    calling to confirm a booking
  Agent:  [asks guest count]
  You:    160 guests
  Agent:  [asks vegan count]
  You:    about 50 need vegan
  Agent:  [asks deposit]
  You:    £200 deposit
  Agent:  [confirms or escalates?]

Conversation 2 (deposit too high):
  Same as above but use a deposit above £300 (e.g. "£500 deposit").

Conversation 3 (out of scope):
  Start normally, then when asked for vegan count say something like
  "can you arrange parking for the speakers?" and observe what happens.
  Does CALM handle this differently than the old rules approach?

I can only help with confirming tonight's venue booking. For anything else, please contact the event organiser directly.

# Describe what CALM did after the out-of-scope message. Min 20 words.
CONVERSATION_3_WHAT_HAPPENED = """
After I asked about parking (out of scope), CALM recognized that this request did not match the current `confirm_booking` flow and triggered the `handle_out_of_scope` flow automatically. It apologized, explicitly stated its limited scope of only being able to help with venue bookings, and then politely asked if I would like to continue with the current booking process, maintaining the conversation context correctly.
"""

# Compare Rasa CALM's handling of the out-of-scope request to what
# LangGraph did in Exercise 2 Scenario 3. Min 40 words.
OUT_OF_SCOPE_COMPARISON = """
In Exercise 2, LangGraph's research agent used an LLM-in-the-loop to determine the next step, which provided great flexibility but sometimes led to verbose or slightly off-target responses when faced with out-of-scope queries. In contrast, Rasa CALM uses explicit, natural-language-defined flows. When it encountered the out-of-scope request, it deterministically routed to a predefined fallback flow (`handle_out_of_scope`), ensuring a consistent and safe brand voice while politely steering me back to the intended task. This predictable behavior is much easier to audit and control in a business environment.

TASK_B_HOW_YOU_TESTED = """
I tested the cutoff guard by temporarily modifying the condition to `if True:` in `actions.py`, then retraining the model and restarting the Rasa action server. I initiated a booking confirmation conversation and verified that the agent immediately escalated the request, correctly citing the 16:45 time-based deadline as the reason for escalation. After confirming it worked, I reverted the code and verified it again.
"""

# ── CALM vs Old Rasa ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# In the old open-source Rasa (3.6.x), you needed:
#   ValidateBookingConfirmationForm with regex to parse "about 160" → 160.0
#   nlu.yml intent examples to classify "I'm calling to confirm"
#   rules.yml to define every dialogue path
#
# In Rasa Pro CALM, you need:
#   flow descriptions so the LLM knows when to trigger confirm_booking
#   from_llm slot mappings so the LLM extracts values from natural speech
#   ONE action class (ActionValidateBooking) for the business rules
#
# What does this simplification cost? What does it gain?
# Min 30 words.

CALM_VS_OLD_RASA = """
CALM significantly simplifies the development process by replacing complex, regex-based Python validation and intent training with natural language flow descriptions and LLM-based slot extraction. While this loses some granular control over traditional NLU training data and introduces probabilistic extraction, it gains immense flexibility in handling varied natural speech and drastically reduces the amount of boilerplate code. The LLM handles the "how" people speak, while Python still handles the deterministic "what" of business rules, providing a clean separation of concerns.
"""

# ── The setup cost ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# CALM still required: config.yml, domain.yml, flows.yml, endpoints.yml,
# rasa train, two terminals, and a Rasa Pro licence.
# The old Rasa ALSO needed nlu.yml, rules.yml, and a FormValidationAction.
#
# CALM is simpler. But it's still significantly more setup than LangGraph.
# That setup bought you something specific.
# Min 40 words.

SETUP_COST_VALUE = """
The Rasa Pro CALM setup is significantly more heavyweight than LangGraph, requiring a license, a dedicated action server, and several structured YAML configuration files. However, this upfront investment buys deterministic state management and highly auditable flows. Unlike the more free-form LangGraph agent, the CALM agent cannot improvise tools or steps that were not explicitly defined in `flows.yml`. This is a critical feature for reliability in business-critical processes like financial confirmations, where "surprising" behavior is a liability rather than an asset.
